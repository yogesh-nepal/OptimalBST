# Optimal Binary Search Tree (OBST)

This repository contains an implementation of the Optimal Binary Search Tree (OBST) algorithm in C#. The OBST algorithm finds the minimum cost of constructing a binary search tree (BST) given certain constraints, such as frequencies of access or success and failure probabilities for keys.

## Features

- **Optimal BST Using Frequencies**: Compute the minimum cost of constructing an optimal BST using keys and their frequencies.
- **Optimal BST Using Probabilities**: Compute the minimum cost of constructing an optimal BST using keys, their success probabilities, and failure probabilities.
- **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Efficiently computes the cost using a dynamic programming approach.
- **Helper Methods**: Includes utility functions for frequency summation, weight calculation, and array printing.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 6.0 SDK or higher
- Visual Studio or any C# compatible IDE
